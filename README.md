# Replace this title!

This file is supposed to contain your project's _global_ documentation.

For now, this repo contains:

- A `frontend` folder, initialized with the command `npx create-react-app frontend`
- A `backend` folder. In it, there is just a basic `package.json` file
- A `misc` folder, where you'll add everything non code-related
